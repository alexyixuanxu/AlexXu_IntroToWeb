For final, I decided to keep working on the game blog I did for midterm.
Something to change:
1. Have all original content for the pages
2. Make the website responsive for different screen sizes (without using bootstrap)
	e.g. 
	will include a dropdown menu for phone size screens
3. Embed some p5.js sketches in the website
4. Add more javascript for interactions and animations
	e.g. 
	change the slideshow on homepage a little so that the images slide automatically;
	press a button to change component on the page, something goofy;
	create animation in game recommendation page using GreenSock or jquery
