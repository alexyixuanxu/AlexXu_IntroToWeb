For final, I decided to keep working on the game blog I did for midterm.
Something to change:
1. Have all original content for the pages
2. Make the website responsive for different screen sizes
3. Embed some p5.js sketches in the website
4. Add more javascript for people to interact with e.g, press a button to change component on the page;
 fade in animation for game recommendation page using GreenSock
