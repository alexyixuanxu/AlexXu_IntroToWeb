I do feel the article makes a lot of sense in terms of knowing the purposes of your project. 
Because I consider a clear purpose would help with a better design process. 
To quote, "Before you start planning a solution, know the problem."
So I would consider questions such as for whom? Why? before I start the project, and then consider how and what to design.
And I realize I would need to be active in the process and ask for feedback as I proceed.
